# Machine Learning-Aided Platform for Point-of-Care Pregnancy Risk Assessment from 2D Ultrasound

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML)-aided platform for point-of-care pregnancy risk assessment using 2D ultrasound images. The platform utilizes state-of-the-art ML models to analyze ultrasound images and provide risk assessments for pregnancy-related complications.

## Features
- Automated analysis of 2D ultrasound images.
- Prediction of pregnancy-related complications such as fetal abnormalities, placental issues, and maternal health risks.
- User-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input ultrasound images and receive risk assessments.
- Integration with existing healthcare systems for seamless adoption.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:

## Usage
1. Run the platform:
2. Access the platform through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Upload 2D ultrasound images for analysis.
4. Receive risk assessments and recommendations based on ML analysis.
